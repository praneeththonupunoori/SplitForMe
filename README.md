SplitForMe
==========

To create a list of Zappos products whose combined values match as closely as possible to the user budget. 


Ex:
if a user entered 3 (# of products) and $150, the application would print combinations of 3 product items whose total value is closest to $150.

The code is written in java.
Used Eclipse(if this info helps)

And I dont want to explain more about my logic as you can see it in my code.. :)
